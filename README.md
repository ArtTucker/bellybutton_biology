# Bellybutton Biodiversity
An exploration of bacterial culture data with javascript, Plotly, D3.js and Bootstrap.

This project page has been deployed and is visible [here](https://arttucker.github.io/bellybutton_biology/).

The project was primarily designed to demonstrate the functionality of Plotly and it's various built-in chart types.

The source data describes a population of 153 subjects, and bacterial cultures sampled from their bellybuttons. Test subjects may chose a test subject's ID number from a dropdown menu to see a variety of data about them:
- How often they washed their bellybutton per week;
- Bacteria cultures found per sample;
- The top 10 bacteria cultures found in that individual subject.
